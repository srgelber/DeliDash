DeliDash Narrative:
The story centers around a lonely heel of bread (named Ry) finding themselves as the last piece of bread in the bread box. As the heel, Ry was less desirable than the other pieces of bread and worries that they will never get eaten before becoming stale or even worse, moldy. Ry sees on the fridge that the next shopping trip is going to be when the owner gets home from work. So in their last ditch effort, Ry must brave the perils of the kitchen and make themselves into a fantastic sandwich despite their faults. After coming home from work tired and exhausted, the owner exclaims that they must have left food out and hates wasting food, eating Ry no matter how tasty they are.
